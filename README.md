#TASK

Landing page

In your groups, you are going to put your knowledge of transform, transition and keyframes together and come up with a landing page for an imaginary start up.

Discuss an idea for your start up
If you want you can choose an existing company, sports team, charity or organisation and use that instead. 

The landing page should contain an animation done with keyframes. It can be as complicated or simple as you feel  comfortable with.

Some examples:

For example, choose a basketball team. You can animate the ball bouncing into stage. 

Or an airline - a plane coming in to land.
